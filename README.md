# kmeans-algorithm-unsupervised-learning-
Unsupervised Learning:
we have features, but no target
depending on the features we are grouping them.
kmeans algorithm---distance and cluster centriods
inertia--number of clusters
we have used differenct data points and centroids.
we have also used iris.csv data sample.
